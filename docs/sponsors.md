# Sponsor Organizations — Overview & Product Insights

## 1. Keep Alachua County Beautiful (KACB)

**Website:** [kacb.org](https://www.kacb.org/)

### What They Do
KACB is an affiliate of Keep America Beautiful operating out of Gainesville, FL. They organize community cleanups, litter prevention campaigns, recycling education, and beautification projects across Alachua County. They provide free supplies (bags, gloves, paint, planting tools) for volunteer-led projects and run large-scale events like The Great American Cleanup.

### What They Are
A 501(c)(3) nonprofit that acts as the **connective tissue between citizens, local businesses, and government** on environmental stewardship. They don't do the work alone — they mobilize and equip volunteers to do it. Their value is coordination, not labor.

### What They Want as a Product
KACB's core bottleneck is **volunteer coordination and impact tracking**. They need to:

- **Recruit, schedule, and manage volunteers** across dozens of cleanup and beautification events per year. Right now this likely lives in spreadsheets and email chains.
- **Track and visualize community impact** — pounds of litter collected, areas cleaned, trees planted, volunteer hours logged. This data is critical for grant applications and continued county/state funding.
- **Streamline supply distribution** — volunteers pick up supplies on limited days (Mon/Thu, 11am–4pm). A reservation or request system could reduce no-shows and waste.
- **Map problem areas** — a reporting tool where citizens flag illegal dumping, littered zones, or areas needing beautification would let KACB prioritize projects with data instead of guesswork.

> **The winning product idea:** A volunteer/event management platform with built-in impact dashboards and a public-facing "report a problem" map. Think of it as their operational command center.

## 2. Mill Creek Farm

**Website:** [millcreekfarm.org](https://millcreekfarm.org/)

### What They Do
Mill Creek Farm is a nonprofit equine sanctuary in Alachua, FL that provides lifelong care for elderly horses rescued from neglect, abuse, or abandonment. They accept horses exclusively from law enforcement, SPCAs, and rescue organizations — never from private owners. Horses live freely in spacious pastures and are cared for until natural death.

### What They Are
A **retirement home for horses**. They are a small, emotionally-driven nonprofit that runs on donations, horse sponsorships, and volunteer labor. They open to the public on Saturdays (11am–3pm) for educational visits. Their brand is compassion and dignity — they promise these animals will never be discarded again.

### What They Want as a Product
Mill Creek Farm's survival depends on **donor engagement and operational efficiency** with very limited staff. They need to:

- **Horse sponsorship management** — sponsors want to feel connected to "their" horse. A profile system with photos, health updates, and stories would increase retention and upselling to higher tiers.
- **Donation pipeline optimization** — recurring donation management, campaign tracking, and automated tax receipt generation. Every dollar matters when you're feeding 100+ horses.
- **Volunteer scheduling** — Saturday visits and daily farm work need hands. A simple sign-up and reminder system prevents understaffing.
- **Animal health/care tracking** — internal records for each horse: veterinary history, diet, medications, intake info. This is critical for aging animals with complex needs.
- **Public visit experience** — a way to book Saturday visits, show which horses are available to meet, and convert visitors into sponsors on the spot.

> **The winning product idea:** A "horse profile + sponsorship portal" paired with an internal animal care management system. The public side turns visitors into recurring donors; the private side keeps the farm running smoothly.

## 3. Operation Catnip

**Website:** [ocgainesville.org](https://ocgainesville.org/)

### What They Do
Operation Catnip is a Gainesville-based nonprofit focused on **Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR)** for free-roaming community cats. They run subsidized spay/neuter clinics, operate a trap lending depot, place cats through a Working Cat Program, divert kittens from the shelter system, and train veterinarians nationwide in community cat medicine.

### What They Are
A **high-volume, logistics-heavy animal welfare operation**. Unlike a shelter, they don't house animals long-term — they process them through a pipeline: trap, fix, vaccinate, return (or place). Their bottleneck is throughput and coordination, not space. They also have a national education mission, training the next generation of vets.

### What They Want as a Product
Operation Catnip juggles multiple complex workflows with limited resources. They need to:

- **Trap inventory and lending management** — track which traps are checked out, to whom, for how long, and whether they've been returned. Lost or hoarded traps directly reduce capacity.
- **Clinic scheduling and capacity management** — spay/neuter clinics have finite slots. A booking system that manages waitlists, appointment confirmations, and no-show backfills would maximize throughput.
- **Colony tracking and mapping** — TNR effectiveness depends on knowing where cat colonies are, how many cats are in each, and which have been fixed. A GIS-based colony map would be transformational for prioritizing resources.
- **Kitten intake/diversion pipeline** — matching found kittens with foster homes and tracking them through to adoption. This is a time-sensitive, chaotic workflow that likely runs on phone calls and Facebook posts.
- **Volunteer/vet-student coordination** — clinics need trained hands. Scheduling volunteers by skill level (surgical assist vs. general help) and tracking training progress for vet students.

> **The winning product idea:** An operations management system with three pillars — trap logistics, clinic scheduling, and colony mapping. This turns their reactive, manual workflows into a proactive, data-driven operation. The colony map alone would be a game-changer for demonstrating impact to funders.

## Cross-Cutting Themes

All three organizations share common pain points that a well-designed product could address:

| Need | KACB | Mill Creek Farm | Operation Catnip |
|---|---|---|---|
| Volunteer management | High | Medium | High |
| Donor/sponsor engagement | Medium | High | Medium |
| Impact tracking & reporting | High | Medium | High |
| Inventory/asset tracking | Medium | Low | High |
| Public-facing engagement tool | High | High | Medium |
| Internal operations/data management | Medium | High | High |

**The common thread:** These are all small nonprofits doing big work with limited staff. They don't need enterprise software — they need **focused, simple tools** that reduce the manual coordination tax so they can spend more time on their actual mission. Whatever you build should prioritize ease of use over feature count. If a volunteer coordinator can't figure it out in 5 minutes, it won't get used.
